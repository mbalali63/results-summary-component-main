## My process

### Built with

As before, I used Tailwind-css framework to do this challenge. The most sophisticated part of the challenge was responsive design. It took me a long time 
to make it. Altough it is not completely the same, but it looks good now. so I publish it and will learn much more about responsive design, especially with Tailwind-CSS.


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS



### What I learned

During this project I learned to use Just-in-Time compiler of Tailwind-css. So, the proper values beyoned those included in tailwind-css defualts, could be used. It was a great and valueable experience for me to work with responsive design possiblities of tailwind. But I need more to practice. I am not good enough, yet.


### Continued development

As mentioned above I have to learn more about responsive desing, especialy with tailwind-css. During this project I just read a bit about design methods, such as Golden-ratio or the rule of thirds. It was so intresting and I have to read and do more about them.


### Useful resources

- [Online Pixel Ruler](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/tools/pixel-ruler.html) - I found this site so helpful while measuring different dimensions of the elements in this project. 
- [Tailwind-CSS Official website](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Official website of tailwind, is the most used reference during projects.
